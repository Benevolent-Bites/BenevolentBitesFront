<p>Benevolent Bites</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<ol type="I">
<li><p><em>Purpose</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Benevolent Bites is a non-profit which aims to improve the financial stability of restaurants as well as their staff by allowing users to prepay for their meals on our platform, and then use the credit at a later date. The cash from the transaction is immediately given to the restaurants, with a portion of it going to the staff as tip money.</p>

<li><p><em>Restaurants</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Restaurants receive the greatest benefit from our platform during periods in which in-person traffic for them is low, such as the current Covid-19 outbreak. Users can put credit into restaurants of their choosing and save it for later, which gives the restaurants &amp; their staff an additional source of income.</p>
<p>To sign up, restaurants will need to enter a few basic details about their establishment into the platform, including their name, address, and description. If the restaurant is already on Yelp, they can also enter their Yelp URL for us to automatically scrape info from.</p>
<p>Additionally, restaurants will need to link a Square account to our service, which will allow them to receive payments.</p>
<ol start="3" type="I">
<li><p><em>Users</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is a non-profit, and so users are encouraged to deposit credit in order to help out restaurants and their staff. We expect that the majority of our users will be buying credit for those restaurants that they visit most frequently, including cafes and popular lunch spots.</p>
<p>Eventually, restaurants will be able to offer promotions on the Benevolent Bites platform, such as giving users $50 of credit for $45, or a similar discount. This opens up opportunities for more user benefits rather than just doing social good.</p>

<li><p><em>Credit Redemption</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once a user purchases credit for a restaurant, their money is sent directly to the restaurant’s Square account. Their credit balance for all places is stored by us. After the user visits a restaurant in-person and finishes enjoying their meal, they can choose to pay through Benevolent Bites credit. Upon purchase of credit, the user is given a QR Code which is then scanned by restaurant staff into our platform. The user’s credit balance is updated in our system, and a confirmation is sent to the restaurant.</p>
<ol start="5" type="I">
<li><p><em>Tips</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>A big part of Benevolent Bites is providing an additional source of income to the staff members of the restaurants. Whenever a user purchases credit, a certain predetermined portion of the funds are designated to be distributed among employees. Since all funds are immediately transferred to a single account, restaurant owners are responsible for distributing the tip money, and are bound to do so by a contract they will sign with us.</p>
<p>Ideally, restaurants will add a list of their staff members’ emails. That way, our system can send periodic emails to restaurant staff to inform them of how much money they should be getting paid.</p>
<ol start="6" type="I">
<li><p><em>Platform Details</em></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Both restaurants &amp; users can view data through the Benevolent Bites dashboard. Users can see which restaurants they have bought credit for, as well as all credit balances. Restaurants can see all outstanding credit, as well as how much they have been paid in total.</p>
